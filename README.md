<h3>A C++11 component-entity system</h3>

This branch is a complete rewrite of the original 1.0 branch, which is heavily influenced in design by C++03.

If you are looking for the original branch, choose 1.0. If you are looking at an updated version for C++11, the unstable master branch may be more appropriate.

This branch is still in development, and will eventually replace the master branch.
